Scripts in this folder are deprecated and are stored for legacy purposes and tracking of progress, at most.

We first put the bss simulations scripts first, because each one of them, simulated scenarios with different prime and n_sources values.

These simulations were put together in a single file for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. And it's easier to manage one single file than many files with different names which does the same simulation, except for different parameters of simulation.
