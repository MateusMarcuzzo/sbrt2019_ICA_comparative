We must use Octave to transform these .txt data to .mat data.
The original data came from Octave scripts, of simulation data.

So we can use scipy.io.loadmat function which loads to python, in a dictionary data structure, the .mat file data.

To later build Dataframe structures with Pandas, and store the values with some data persistency and easier management.

With these data, we want to do some statistical tests.
